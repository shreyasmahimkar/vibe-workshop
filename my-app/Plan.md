# Development Plan for Kanban Board Application

## Phase 1: Basic Layout and Styling
- Create a static Kanban board layout with three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".
- Add dummy tasks to each column for visual representation.
- Apply basic styling to mimic GitHub's design, including fonts, colors, and spacing.

## Phase 2: Interactive Features
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality to move cards between columns.
- Add the ability to create new cards within each column.
- Enable editing and deleting cards.
- Allow users to create and delete columns dynamically.

## Phase 3: Workflow Management
- Enforce a Work-In-Progress (WIP) limit for each column to manage task load.
- Add functionality to assign priority levels to cards (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Display priority visually on each card.

## Phase 4: Data Persistence
- Integrate a backend or local storage to save the state of the Kanban board.
- Ensure cards, columns, and their states persist across page reloads.

## Phase 5: User Authentication
- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own Kanban boards.
- Implement secure login and registration features.

## Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Add support for task descriptions, due dates, and labels.
- Implement search and filter functionality for cards.
- Allow users to customize column names and add new columns.

## Phase 7: Deployment
- Optimize the application for performance and responsiveness.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
- Monitor and fix any post-deployment issues.
